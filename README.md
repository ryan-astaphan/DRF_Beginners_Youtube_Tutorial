# Another DRF Beginner's Tutorial

## They key takeaway from this course was that ModelViewsets are awesome.
But I only learned that in the last minutes of this lesson. Prior to that I deepened my knowledge of the following topics:

* Serializers (serializers.Serializer and serializers.ModelSerializer)
* Function-based views
* The @api_view decorator for defining request methods in function-based views
* The basic class-based view, APIView, which enables a browsable api
* Generic class-based views, with added functionality via mixins
* Authentication (Basic auth, session auth and token auth) and Permissions (IsAuthenticated)
* Viewsets and Routers, Generic viewsets, and the almighty ModelViewset

### *Note:* In this project I followed [Parwiz Forogh's Youtube tutorial](https://youtu.be/B38aDwUpcFc).
